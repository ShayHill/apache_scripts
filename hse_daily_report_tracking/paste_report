Diver down, jetting hole to prep for cut with Super "C" saw on 12" line. Once prepped, saw was set in place using crane. Noted that all studs are out of the flange. Standoff cut was completed, then rigged up strap to SSTI. Line carefully moved away from the live 12" hot tap successfully. Pipe brought to surface and placed on deck. It has too much hydrocarbons and oily sludge to use acetylene torch to cut it up. Pipe is 20' x 12' and NO NORM detected. 12" blind flange sent down to diver via crane. Diver had to had jet around to clear room to place blind flange. Placed successfully, and all studs were tightened with hammer wrench, and ready to be tensioned. End of working day. Noted it was extremely hot today with zero wind. Tenders rotated taking breaks in the galley to cool off, so to avoid any heat injuries.

Making dive, as directed, to check if pig is in valve assembly connected to port 6" blind. Diver in water and disassembled 90° from port blind, located pig coming out of 6" ported blind. The 1/4 assembly was brought to surface and placed on deck. Diver is loosening bolts to try to retrieve the pig. During this process, noted small amounts of product coming out. Pollution dome was set up, along with hose. Diver was able to get the pig out of the pipe, but is now trying to get it out of 2" port on blind flange. New diver was able to remove the oil saturated 12" pig that is jammed in the 6" pipe/valve, which was sent up to save foe the client rep. Diver then opened valve #4 to stick a 7' hand probe to see if there are any other obstructions. Diver reported he hit something approximately 5' in. Reinstalled 6" flushing flange back on pipe. Replaced bad section of HP flushing hose. Diver made fitting tight, and opened up the 2 HP valves on flushing hose. Diver then double verified that valves #2 & #4 and the two HP valves on flushing hose were all in the open position. All is correct. DSV Triton Crusader backed away, and Odyssea Leader notified to maneuver to pick up hose. Once picked up, Odyssea Leader called "All Stop" as they are not able to push the pig through the 2" flushing hose. Diver back in water to close valves #2 & #4, then remove flushing hose. When breaking the union on the flushing hose, the diver reported that the Atlas pig was coming out of the union fitting.

HSE, Company man, PIC and Construction Sup. Surveyed jobsite for hazards and additional information for JSEAs. Safety Meeting held with crew communicating current hazards and job scope. JSEAs were reviewed and signed by all crew before boarding platform. All paperwork is on jobsite for adjustments to JSEAs if needed. While waiting on crane part crew began cutting grading around last remaining build on south end of drill deck. Once part arrived around noon, crane was test ran and no issues noted. Building was relocated to North end of drill deck and various other items were relocated as well to make room for new grating and eventually new support beams. Hard barricade was in place around build prior to lift and crew remained 100% tied off while working on inside of barricade. Crew then began washing and prepping area to lay grating that has already been pre-cut where building was located while waiting to backload GOL Brave. Once it came time to backload vessel (7pm) the crane once again went down and was unable to be restarted.. This activity took up the rest of day and crew returned to vessel via swing rope without incident.
